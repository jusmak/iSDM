# Integrated species distribution models to improve occurrence predictions and alleviate data deficiencies

This repo includes codes for running integrative spatially explicit SDMs which use heterogeneous presence-only and checklist based presence-absence data. Models are validated with block-wise and random cross-validation for presence-absence data and with independen expert range maps. There are additional functions for computing different metrics of species ranges and model predictions.
