# To support the manuscript "Integrated species distribution models to account for sampling biases and improve range wide occurrence predictions"

This repo includes codes for running integrative spatially explicit SDMs which use heterogeneous presence-only and checklist based presence-absence data. Models are validated with block-wise cross-validation for presence-absence data and with independen expert range maps. There are additional functions for computing different metrics of species ranges and model predictions.
